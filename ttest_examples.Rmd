```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Confidence intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length)

```


## T-test (1-sample t-test)

see a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test

```

## 2 Sample T-test 

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```


## it is the probability if the null hypothesis is true (pops have the same mean) that we could have gotten samples with means that are at least as different as our are. prob low, less and less likely to draw samples randomly with same mean. really high...
